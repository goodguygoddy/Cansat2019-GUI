### What is cansat?

A CanSat is a type of sounding rocket payload used to teach space technology. It is similar to the technology used in miniaturized satellites. No CanSat has ever left the atmosphere, nor orbited the earth.

### Mission for 2019
The 2019 mission will explore the use of auto-gyro descent control of a science payload when
released from the launch vehicle. The CanSat shall consist of two parts, the science payload
and the container to protect the science payload as it is deployed from the rocket.
The Cansat shall be launched to an altitude ranging 670 meters to 725 meters above the
launch site and deployed near apogee (peak altitude). Orientation of deployment is not
controlled and is most definitely violent. The CanSat container must protect the science
payload from damage during the launch and deployment.

Once the CanSat is deployed from the rocket, the CanSat shall descend using a parachute at
a descent rate of 20 m/s. At 450 meters, the container shall release science auto-gyro
payload. The descent rate shall be 10 to 15 m/s. As the science payload descends under
auto-gryo control, the payload shall transmit telemetry which shall include sensors to track
altitude using air pressure, external temperature, battery voltage, GPS position, pitch and roll
and auto-gyro blade spin rate. When the science payload lands, all telemetry transmission
shall stop and a located audio beacon shall activate.
